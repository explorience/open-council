# THE PEER PRODUCTION LICENSE (PPL)

## A COPYFARLEFT LICENSE

## Version 1.0

## PREAMBLE

This license is based on the Peer Production License created by Michel Bauwens, Vasilis Kostakis, and the P2P Foundation, in collaboration with Dmytri Kleiner.

The intent of this license is to allow a commons of collective ownership to emerge while recognizing the contributions of labor and prohibiting the exploitation of that labor by private capital. 

With this license, a copyleft principle is applied exclusively for other commons-oriented entities, cooperatives, and nonprofits, while use by for-profit entities is restricted unless they contribute back to the commons.

## NOTICE

This is a legally untested license. While based on established copyleft principles and the Creative Commons framework, the Peer Production License has not been extensively tested in courts. Users should be aware that its enforceability may vary by jurisdiction.

The Peer Production License is NOT a Free Software or Open Source license as defined by the FSF or OSI, as it discriminates based on use and user type. This is intentional - the license aims to build a commons that resists capitalist extraction rather than enabling it.
