Hi [Councillor Name],

I'm launching Open Council, a simple website that makes council voting records easily searchable for London residents. 

As someone who consistently supports transparency and civic engagement, I thought you might be interested. The tool is completely non-partisan - it simply presents voting data in an accessible format.

Would you be willing to share this with your constituents when it launches? I believe it could help more Londoners engage with local democracy.

Happy to answer any questions!
