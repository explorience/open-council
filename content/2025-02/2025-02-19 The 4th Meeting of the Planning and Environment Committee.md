[2025-02-19 - Deputy Mayor Lewis - Motion for Dundas Street Repairs](<https://pub-london.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=114407>)

> Moved by S. Lewis

> Seconded by S. Hillier

That the Civic Administration BE DIRECTED to suspend any further considerations of the “Dundas Streetscape Master Plan for the Argyle Core Area” with regard to the immediate need for road rehabilitation in 2025 of Dundas Street between Burdick Place and Beatrice St. due to extremely poor pavement condition (low PQI rating) and proceed with the rehabilitation planned prior to this plan;



it being noted that funding for the Dundas Streetscape Master Plan CIP was not included in the 2024-2027 MYB or annual updates;



it being further noted that reducing costs on capital projects for non-essential elements is consistent with the “Strong Mayor” direction to the Civic Administration to bring forward options for a budget rate of under 5% for 2026;



it being further noted that Planning and Environment Committee Received the following communication with respect to this matter:

-    a communication dated February 13, 2025 from B. Mejia and R. Graham - Argyle BIA
