# Why the Peer Production License?

This project uses the Peer Production License (PPL) rather than a traditional open source license. This choice is intentional and aligned with our values of building regenerative, post-capitalist systems.

## What This Means

✅ **You CAN freely use this code if you are:**
- A worker-owned cooperative
- A nonprofit organization  
- An individual creator or freelancer
- An educational institution
- A commons-oriented project
- Any entity where workers democratically control the organization

❌ **You CANNOT use this code commercially if you are:**
- A traditional for-profit corporation owned by investors
- A venture capital-backed startup
- Any entity that extracts profit from workers' labor without democratic ownership

## Why Not MIT/GPL/Apache?

Traditional open source licenses were revolutionary for their time, but they enable surveillance capitalism and exploitation. Companies worth billions have been built on open source labor without reciprocating value to the commons.

The PPL is part of building a different future - one where:
- Cooperation is favored over competition
- Workers control their own labor
- The commons grows stronger, not corporate profits
- Technology serves community needs, not capital accumulation

## For Traditional Businesses

If you're a traditional for-profit company and want to use this code, you can:
1. Contact us to negotiate a reciprocity agreement
2. Transition toward worker ownership
3. Contribute significant value back to the commons
